    In five years, I would love to be an industry expert that others can go to for ideas, help and strategy.
    <br><br>
    I’ve had amazing mentors and managers, so I’d like to be able to provide similar guidance, potentially taking on a
    leadership role.
    <br><br>
    Finally, I’d like to have taken the lead on projects I’m passionate about. I’m motivated by using my skills to
    deliver
    the TAL’s larger business goals.
