    I reflected on my process and broadly it seems I have two process, depending on if the project has a team or if it's
    an individual project.
    <br><br>
    I have been testing and learning my process over time.
    <br><br>
    TEAM PROJECTS
    <br><br>
    For team projects I have learnt along the way that there can be some time equal weight to both internal change
    management as to the delivery of a successful project:
    <br><br>
    For team projects, it all starts with understanding - such as a collaborative workshop to produce share
    understanding. I find that service blueprints work well for this, as they span the entire process and also from
    service to technology allowing for people to input into the part where they are the most comfortable.
    <br><br>
    After a share understand is gathered then its co-design, or ideation
    <br><br>
    This allows everyone to get input into the process and get their ideas heard
    <br><br>

    Most often what follows is the creating of a design artefact that can be tested.
    <br><br>
    This sets off the test and learn where the team can see how customers, partners are responding to the idea.
    <br><br>

    If it's an individual or designers heavy project, on reflection they seem to start with learnt knowledge. Drawing on
    the learnings from other projects that I have completed in the past.
    <br><br>
    Once there is a skeleton down, I move to customer testing / research, in these types of projects it's about getting
    customer input at the earliest stage. 1. To find customer insights quickly 2. For rapid iterations.
