    To be honest, I think TAL can continue to offer me with an environment where I can put my skills to the best
    possible use.
    <br><br>
    I can use the insurance and business knowledge which I have gained over the years and make a major difference, as
    well as help this TAL, grow collectively.
    <br><br>
    What more can I ask for than this? To work in an atmosphere where I have the freedom to paint my own thoughts and
    bring out the best
    <br><br>
    is really what I look forward to.
    <br><br>
    This job suits all my needs and skills perfectly.
    <br><br>
    I have spent a significant amount of time in developing and nurturing my design, technology and leadership skills
    and this I feel is the best place for me to apply each one of them.
