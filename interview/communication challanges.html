    Riders - in a digital fromat

    <br><br>
    I will speak about this as it show communication with customers and

    <br><br>
    with the ET







    In the past for a long time it was thought of internally that apps where similar to websites
    <br><br>
    They were thought of as in pages
    <br><br>

    I remember having trouble communicating that while TAC was only under 10 pages it was not about the pages

    <br><br>

    But about the components

    <br><br>

    Take for example the quoting page.

    <br><br>

    Its a single page that can be in a number of configurations

    <br><br>

    This was quite the challenge communicating that we should think and develop in terms of components

    <br><br>

    To solve this communication challenge I did the following:

    <br><br>
    1. Talk in components ( such as the Life insurance card, the policy price display component )

    <br><br>
    2. Reinforce the idea by setting up component style guides within our prototypes and wireframes

    <br><br>

    This consisted of a large page where all the components required for the page were outlined

    <br><br>
    with all the possible states and later UI design


    <br><br>
    Over time by <strong>showing not telling </strong> we were able to communicate the value of thinking about
    components

    <br><br>
    Which allowed us to talk about specific parts of the application and dig down into the required behaviours and
    design

    <br><br>
    And allowed me to plan better, and communicate when the wireframes / components would be finished
