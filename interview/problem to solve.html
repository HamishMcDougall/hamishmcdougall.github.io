    I have delivered a number of projects at TAL. It's hard for me to think of one. I am going to talk about TAC as it
    had
    the largest amount of problems to solve and the greatest successes.
    <br><br>

    TAC - Testing with advisors.
    <br><br>
    How do you talk with your Advisors there is not a culture of talking with them.
    <br><br>
    Prior to TAC, TAL didn't talk with their advisers about how they went about their business. One of the key pillars
    in my
    design process is always researching with the end user. Whether it be customers, partners or advisers.
    <br><br>
    At the start of the project we were given, what I would say was a document that was over 500 pages. That has been
    shopped around TAL with everyone’s input into what TAC should be. At this stage no one had spoken with a single
    adviser,
    or their staff who would end up ultimately using TAC.
    <br><br>
    I fist put together the a proposal to "shadow" advisers in their workplace to gain an understanding of how they went
    about conducting their business, what were their workflows, where were they spending the most amount of time. It got
    the
    nod from the business. However, after some time it seemed to have stalled. The appetite to talk to advisers just
    wasn't
    there.








    <br><br>

    I formulated a plan:
    <br><br>
    1. I put together a presentation document that outlined what I thought would be there biggest objections:
    <br><br>
    • Why we should speak to advisers, and the value it would bring.
    <br><br>
    • What type of questions will we ask advisers. Including a set of questions.
    <br><br>
    • How we would deal with 'tricky' adviser questions about TAL and the AP product.
    <br><br>
    2. I presented it to Gavin and Nihil, it was met with a few nods. But after some time, it didn't seem to go
    anywhere.
    <br><br>
    I was determined to speak with Advisors so we could build something that helped them work smarter and write double
    the
    amount of business in half the time. And I knew that we couldn't do that without their input.
    <br><br>
    3. I fully committed and<strong> weighed up the risks</strong> and outcomes. We had established a customer testing
    framework and
    practice
    that we used in the previous project. I decided to engage our recruitment partners in finding TAL advisers. They
    were
    successful, armed with a list of TAL advisers I re-presented it back to Gavin and Nihill. This time they could see
    the
    value. However they didn't like the list of advisers that we had recruited.
    <br><br>
    What happened next was that I was put in touch with Barnsey and I presented again the value researching with
    advisers.
    Barnesy then provided me with an approved list of Advisers that we could speak with. There were some conditions at
    the
    start it had to be through the BDM and the BDM had rights to come out and sit while we talked to the Advisers.
    <br><br>
    All in all the research with advisers turned out well we presented back our findings ( a number of workflow diagrams
    and
    pain points ) to the business that went on to form the foundation of the project and at the same time dispels some
    myths
    we had internal.
    <br><br>
    On top of that I ended up using a video of the advisors talking about the product and testing in my presentation to
    the
    <strong>TAL board, and at the Retail Sales conference.</strong>
    <br><br>
    I believe this helped in normalising testing and conducting research with advisors.
    <br><br>
    We have since gone on to<strong> use some of these advisers in a number of projects including Digital Adviser, fact
      find,
      and
      the Retail Journey Map,</strong>
